## Outline Discussion
- give basic overview of hypothesis
- describe the task and analysis procedure
- review important findings of current study
- check theoretical implications (find anything of interest)?
- describe importance of this body of research
- limitations: task-used, DDM model can't fit this? stimuli generation usw.
- **can already discuss some of the limitations!**

## No random effects
To reduce estimation time and complexity and because individual differences are not of interest here
