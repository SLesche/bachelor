# Discussion

## Problems
GoNogo task
participants
Model stuff (DDM adequate, too low sample size?) Check number of trials per cell (2x2)
Discuss the reasons for my PES approach (having both post-nogo)


## Outline Discussion
- give basic overview of hypothesis
- describe the task and analysis procedure
- review important findings of current study
- check theoretical implications (find anything of interest)?
- describe importance of this body of research
- limitations: task-used, DDM model can't fit this? stimuli generation usw.
- **can already discuss some of the limitations!**

## No random effects
To reduce estimation time and complexity and because individual differences are not of interest here

## Nogo debacle
In robust: Error trials always post-nogo, correct always post-go
- but: rt post-nogo is faster than post-go (show this) so that doesn't cause pes
- find out DDM changes post-nogo compared to post-go

In classic: Error trials always post-response, correct always post-inhibition
- study effects of inhibition on rt and ddm (meaning correct nogo vs. correct go)

Maybe say: Effect of error on rt not generalizable to "errors" in general but more specific to inhibition errors in nogo trials. Should be on the safe side with that.

Effect of error should depend on a) requirements of task and b) the process that failed
- maybe find some evidence of that
