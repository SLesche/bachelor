We conducted a power analysis using the the R package `superpower` [@R-Superpower] with values based on previous studies [@dutilh2012testing; @dutilh2013] to determine the minimum sample size needed to detect an interaction effect of RSI and _previous accuracy_ (post-correct vs. post-error) on drift rate and boundary separation. Mean values for each cell were entered into the model to estimate effect sizes, returning interaction effects of partial $\eta^2 =$ `r partial_eta_interaction_drift` and `r partial_eta_interaction_boundary` for effects on drift rate and boundary separation, respectively. Using bonferroni corrected significance criteria of $\alpha$ = `r alpha_level_power` and power $= .80$, minimum sample size required to detect the hypothesized interaction effects was estimated to be N = `r required_n_boundary` for effects on boundary separation and N = `r required_n_drift` for effects on drift rate. Exact values entered into analysis can be found in Table \@ref(tab:appendix-mean-values-power-analysis) in the appendix. We recruited a total of `r demo_output$n_subjects` (`r demo_output$n_women` females, M = `r round(demo_output$mean_age, 2)`, SD = `r round(demo_output$sd_age, 2)`) participants to ensure adequate power even after potential drop out. Participants were tested in a single session, gave informed consent and received course credit for their participation.

## Materials
The experiment was programmed using the PsychoPy software [@peirce2019]. We used a modified version of the Behavior Adaptation Task (BAT) [@hester2007] -- a motor-inhibition Go-NoGo task. Stimuli consisted of a stream of the letters X and Y presented in black centrally on a grey background (see Figure \@ref(fig:method-bat-example)). Subjects were asked to respond to the letters when they occurred in an alternating pattern (Go-trial) but withhold their response on repeated presentation of a stimulus (NoGo-trial). Letters measured approximately 2.5 degrees vertically, the fixation cross measured 1 degree horizontally and vertically and was printed black.

## Procedure
Participants were asked to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. Instructions on response mappings of stimuli X and Y to the response keys D and L were counterbalanced across participants. Stimuli were presented for 800ms or until a response was given. We set the RSI to 200ms for the short condition and 1000ms for the long condition. A fixation cross was presented during the RSI. Participants completed 30 practice trials, 15 of which with short RSI and 15 with long RSI. Participants only received feedback informing them about their performance in practice trials. RSI was manipulated between experimental blocks, with six blocks consisting of 250 trials each being presented per RSI condition. Blocks of short and long RSI occurred in an alternating pattern, beginning with the long RSI condition. A self-paced break was administered following each experimental block. **instruction screens (german) can be found in supplementary materials?)** The sequence of appearance of stimuli X and Y was generated pseudo-randomly. Fourfold repetitions of a stimulus were prohibited, and NoGo-trials were always preceded by another NoGo-trial or at least two Go-trials. This was done to ensure that post-error trials were never simultaneously pre-error trials. 

## Data preparation
All response times shorter than 150ms were excluded from analysis. Mean RT and accuracy for each participant in each combination of RSI and trial type was considered an outlier if the participants' mean deviated more than 3 standard deviations from the mean across participants for that combination of RSI and trial type. A total of `r n_outliers` participants were excluded due to this criterion. Within-participant logarithmized reaction times deviating more than 3 standard deviations from the participants' condition-specific mean were also considered outliers. Of the `r nrow(rt_data)` trials `r paste(formattable::percent((n_outliers*3000) / nrow(final_data)))` of trials were lost due to participant exclusion, `r demo_output$percentage_trials_lost`% of trials were lost due to single trial outliers, leaving `r nrow(final_data)` trials for analysis.

## Behavioral Analysis
Only errors in NoGo trials were considered _error trials_ relevant for PES analysis. PES was defined using the traditional approach [@dutilh2012how; @pfister2022]. 
$$\Delta_{PES} = \overline{RT_{E+1}} - \overline{RT_{C+1}}$$
Mean reaction times $\overline{RT}$ in Go trials following an _error trial_ $E+1$ are compared to mean reaction times following a correct response to a NoGo trial $C+1$. Effects of RSI condition and accuracy of the previous NoGo trial and their interaction were then examined using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Post-error accuracy (PEA) was examined in a similar manner, comparing mean accuracy following a correct NoGo trial to mean accuracy of trials following an _error trial_.

## Diffusion model specification
**Describe procedure for diffusion model**
The diffusion model was estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical approach implemented in the `brms` package [@R-brms_a]. **talk about why this good. Why Bayesian good, why hierarchical good? Lower trial_n required usw.** **talk about prior specification and formula used**
- with what programs were models fit?
- how was PES measured (robust classification)
- how diffusion model

Analysis was conducted using `r r_citations`.
