```
We conducted a power analysis using the the R package `superpower` [@R-Superpower] with values based on previous studies [@dutilh2012testing; @dutilh2013] to determine the minimum sample size needed to detect an interaction effect of RSI and _trial type_ (pre- vs. post-error) on drift rate and boundary separation. Mean values for each cell were entered into the model to estimate effect sizes, returning interaction effects of partial $\eta^2 =$ `r partial_eta_interaction_drift` and `r partial_eta_interaction_boundary` for effects on drift rate and boundary separation, respectively. Using bonferroni corrected significance criteria of $\alpha$ = `r alpha_level_power` and power $= .80$, minimum sample size required to detect the hypothesized interaction effects was estimated to be N = `r required_n_boundary` for effects on boundary separation and N = `r required_n_drift` for effects on drift rate. Exact values entered into analysis can be found in Table \@ref(tab:appendix-mean-values-power-analysis) in the appendix.

**write this section better, clear outline participants, method, materials usw.**

## Participants
We reached our goal of `r required_n_drift` participants more quickly than expected and decided to include all remaining appointments into our study reaching a total of `r demo_output$n_subjects` (`r demo_output$n_women` females, `r round(demo_output$mean_age, 2)` &pm; `r round(demo_output$sd_age, 2)` years of age) participants. Participants were tested in a single session, gave informed consent and received course credit for their participation.

## Materials
The experiment was programmed using the PsychoPy software [@peirce2019]. We used a modified version of the Behavior Adaptation Task (BAT) [@hester2007] -- a motor-inhibition Go-NoGo task. Stimuli consisted of a stream of the letters X and Y presented centrally on a grey background. Subjects were asked to respond to the letters when they occurred in an alternating pattern (Go-trial) but withhold their response on repeated presentation of a stimulus (NoGo-trial).
**Stimuli size and monitor specs here?** **definitely stimulus size and fixation cross size**
<!-- Instructions on response mappings of stimuli X and Y to the response keys D and L were counterbalanced across participants. Only errors in NoGo-trials were considered _error trials_ used for further analysis in order decrease variance of processes leading to an error. **this isn't quite right, is it? Why don't I use other errors?** -->

## Procedure
Participants were asked to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. Stimuli were presented for 800ms or until a response was given. We set the RSI to 200ms for the short condition and 1000ms for the long condition. A fixation cross was presented during the RSI. Participants completed 30 practice trials, 15 of which with short RSI and 15 with long RSI. Participants only received feedback informing them about their performance in practice trials. RSI was manipulated between experimental blocks, with six blocks consisting of 250 trials each being presented per RSI condition. Blocks of short and long RSI occurred in an alternating pattern, beginning with the long RSI condition. A self-paced break was administered following each experimental block. **instruction screens (german) can be found in supplementary materials?)** The sequence of appearance of stimuli X and Y was generated pseudo-randomly. Fourfold repetitions of a stimulus were prohibited, and NoGo-trials were always preceded by another NoGo-trial or at least two Go-trials. This was done to ensure that post-error trials were never simultaneously pre-error trials. 

## Data analysis
- with what programs were models fit?
- how was PES measured (robust classification)

Analysis was conducted using `r r_citations`.
