abstract: |
  Post-error slowing (PES) describes the increase in response times on trials following errors, often accompanied by changes accuracy. Theories aiming to explain post-error effects often posit adaptive or maladaptive processes. Adaptive processes, such as increased caution, lead to increases in accuracy. Maladaptive processes, such as decreased attention, lead to decreases in accuracy. We aimed to investigate the impact of the response-stimulus interval (RSI) on the relative strength of adaptive versus maladaptive processes following error trials using a Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM).
  
    We employed a motor-inhibition Go-NoGo task. 93 participants completed 3000 trials across a short (200 ms) and a long (1000 ms) RSI condition. In our data, response time increased and accuracy decreased following errors. These effects were more pronounced in the short RSI condition. We failed to fit the DDM to data in the short RSI condition due to a censored response-time distribution in post-error trials. Following errors in the long RSI condition, drift rate decreased, boundary separation decreased and non-decision time increased.
  
  Behavioral results suggest stronger attentional deficits following errors in the short RSI condition. We were not able to compare DDM parameters between the two RSI conditions, limiting insight into cognitive processes. DDM results obtained in the long RSI condition suggest both decreases in caution and attention following errors, supporting the account of post-error recklessness. However, issues in task design lead us to strongly question the validity of DDM parameters obtained here.
