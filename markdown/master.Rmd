abstract: |
  Post-error slowing (PES) describes the increase in response times following errors. This slowing is often accompanied by changes in post-error accuracy. Both accuracy increases as well as accuracy decreases were observed in several previous studies. These differences suggest that different cognitive processes underlie PES. Adaptive processes, such as increased caution, lead to increased accuracy on trials following errors. Maladaptive processes, such as decreased attention, lead to dimished accuracy. We investigated the impact of the response-stimulus interval (RSI) on the relative strength of adaptive versus maladaptive processes following error trials using a Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM).
  
    Behavioral results show increases in response time and decreases in accuracy especially in the short RSI condition. We failed to fit the DDM to data in the short RSI condition due to extreme censoring of the respone-time distribution in post-error trials. DDM analysis of the long RSI condition show decreases in drift rate, decreases in boundary separation and increases in non-decision time following errors.
  
  In contrast to almost all previous studies, these results suggest decreases in caution following errors. This supports the account of post-error recklessness. We attribute these differences in our results to those obtained previously to both model issues preventing us from obtaining valid parameters as well as specifics of the task employed here. Our issues emphasize the importance of task selection when studying post-error slowing. They should also serve as a warning to further researchers aiming to use PES as a measure of cognitive control. Several factors in study and task design may influence not only the size of PES but also the nature of cognitive processes underlying PES.
