# Introduction
"What does a man do after he makes an error?" this title of the seminal article by @rabbitt1977 holds a question relevant for much of everyday life, and most certainly a question to be answered by research. The prevailing answer seems to be "he slows down" [e.g. @laming1968; @rabbitt1966a]. This phenomenon, entering psychological literature under the name _post-error slowing_ (PES), describes the change in response times after subjects completing a reaction-time task commit an error [@laming1968; @laming1979; @rabbitt1966a; @rabbitt1966b; @rabbitt1977; @rabbitt1979]. Average response times in trials immediately following an error are often slower than average response times in trials following a correct response. The cause of PES is still widely discussed [see @danielmeier2011 for a brief overview] and often attributed to one of two general lines of thought.

The first line of thought attributes PES to changes in information processing aiming to prevent further errors. These accounts of PES predict that error commission leads to slower response times but improved accuracy in trials following an error. Subjects that commit an error try to prevent further occurrence of errors by slowing down their response, leading to a less error-prone _speed-accuracy tradeoff_ [@rabbitt1979] or by exerting cognitive control over the decision process, leading to longer but more accurate responses [@botvinick2001]. Accounts attributing PES to cognitive processes that lead to _improved_ accuracy in post-error trials will henceforth be referred to as _adaptive accounts_ of PES.

The other line of thought claims PES to be a result of processes leading to diminished accuracy following an error. @notebaert2009 posit that error responses in research settings are often rarer than correct responses. The pure infrequency of an error commission then leads to an orienting response, diverting attention away from the current task and affecting performance on the trial following an infrequent error. @jentzsch2009 argue that given responses are always monitored for errors [see also @welford1959]. This _error-monitoring process_ requires cognitive resources which cease to be available to central cognitive processes tasked with generating a response to a new stimulus. Response times on that new task will be increased if the monitoring process endures longer than the time between the potential error response and the onset of the following (post-error) trial.
<!-- Monitoring processes following erroneous responses require longer evidence accumulation to come to a conclusion, likely because both the executed incorrect and appropriate correct response are represented. This in turn generates conflicting information whose resolution requires longer duration error-monitoring processes [@laming1979; @rabbitt1977]. -->
Following an error, monitoring processes are more likely to impair cognitive resources otherwise directed towards the task at hand [@laming1979; @rabbitt1977]. Responses following an error are therefore slower and less accurate. Accounts attributing PES to cognitive processes leading to _reduced_ accuracy in post-error trials will be referred to as _maladaptive accounts_ of PES.

Adaptive and maladaptive accounts of PES both posit an increase in response time in trials following an error but seem to be at odds regarding the accuracy of post-error trials. Support for adaptive accounts of PES comes from behavioral data [@laming1979; @steinhauser2017; @mooji2021], mathematical models of cognitive processes [@dutilh2012testing; @schiffler2017] and neurophysiological research using electroencephalography (EEG) [@carp2009; @saunders2012]. Conversely, a variety of studies show behavioral decreases in accuracy following errors [@dali2022error; @vanderborght2016errors; @dudschig2009; @jentzsch2009; @houtman2013] or following infrequent events more generally [@castellar2010; @notebaert2009]. Further support for maladaptive accounts can be found in studies showing impaired cognitive processes as measured via EEG [@buzzel2017; @vanderborght2016errors] or as mapped by mathematical models of reaction time [@purcell2016; @dutilh2013; @schiffler2017].
<!-- - false correct feedback leading to faster rt, reflecting cognitive control accounts [@saunders] **leaving this in here, because I grouped him with eeg stuff, which isnt his strongers point. the argument outlined here is true reason** -->
<!-- - impaired sensory processing P1 [@buzzel2017] and N1 [@vanderborght2016errors] -->
<!-- - reduced accuracy following infrequent events  -->
<!-- - reduced accuracy in post-error trials [@dali2022error; @vanderborght2016errors; @dudschig2009; @jentzsch2009; @houtman2013] -->

Intrigued by the diversity of findings regarding the functionality of PES, @jentzsch2009 identified a key variable moderating the influence of processes deemed adaptive or maladaptive -- the response-stimulus interval (RSI). Depending on the time between a subject's response to trial _n_ and the onset of trial _n+1_, Jentzsch and Dudschig were able to observe different patterns of accuracy changes following an error. When the RSI was long (1000ms), errors led to increased response times and a slight increase in accuracy, lending support to adaptive accounts of PES. Was the RSI short (50ms) on the other hand, the same increase in response times was paired with a decrease in accuracy, a finding supporting maladaptive accounts. The same pattern of shorter RSI leading to decreases in accuracy, while longer RSI led to increases or significantly smaller accuracy losses was replicated for four different levels of RSI [@dudschig2009]. The time between an error response and the onset of the trial following it thus influences whether patterns supporting adaptive or maladaptive accounts are found.

Even though adaptive and maladaptive accounts postulate different cognitive processes underlying PES, these explanations are not necessarily mutually exclusive [@danielmeier2011; @steinhauser2017; @schiffler2017]. **Maybe move this sentence somewhere later? Now it says that the two are not mutually exclusive, but then goes on to explain each of their timing separately** Depending on trial timing, specifically the onset of trial _n+1_ following an error, different cognitive processes may influence response timing. Error-monitoring processes only impair response time and accuracy if they last longer than the RSI. Should the error-monitoring process of trial _n_ come to a conclusion prior to the start of trial _n+1_, central cognitive resources are fully available to be dedicated to responding to trial _n+1_ [@jentzsch2009; @dudschig2009]. Similarly, orienting responses following the infrequent appearance of an error are deemed to only divert attention away from the task for a short period of time, after which the subject refocuses on the task at hand [@notebaert2009]. Cognitive processes hypothesized to be responsible for PES by adaptive accounts, such as increased cognitive control being recruited after an error, take some amount of time before they can influence information processing [@botvinick2001]. Adaptive changes to information processing thus exert more control over response times of trial _n+1_ at long RSI than at short RSI. Depending on the RSI between trial _n_ in which an error is committed and trial _n+1_, different cognitive processes underlie PES [@ullsperger2016].

@buzzel2017 employed the use of an electroencephalogram (EEG) to examine cognitive processes responsible for PES at different RSI. Changes in certain components of _event related potentials_ (ERP), specifically reduced P1 amplitude following an error, reflect attentional deficits leading to impaired sensory processing. Reduced P1 amplitude was however only observed at short RSI. At long RSI these deficits are not present, indicating support for the time-specificity of attentional deficits elicited by errors.

<!-- Because my supervisor won't let me use EEG to investigate my hypothesis... -->
The present study will make use of _evidence accumulation models_ (EAM) more specifically the _drift diffusion model_ (DDM) [@ratcliff1978] to investigate cognitive processes underlying behavior in reaction-time tasks. EAM enable mapping model parameters to specific cognitive processes responsible for response-behavior of each subject [@voss2004; @dutilh2012testing].
<!-- Response times and accuracy can be entered into the model jointly, avoiding speed-accuracy tradeoff issues regarding the separate interpretation of reaction time and accuracy [@wagenmakers2007; @wickelgren1977]. -->
Behavioral data can then be accounted for by multiple model parameters each carrying information about cognitive processes underlying a subject's responses. 

In order to be comparable to previous research on PES using EAM [@purcell2016; @dutilh2012testing; @dutilh2013; @schiffler2017], this study will focus on modeling response data using the DDM. Recent publications have however pointed to potential issues arising with fitting DDM to PES data and have suggested using _linear ballistic accumulator_ (LBA) modeling to avoid misfits [@damaso2022]. Future research will aim to compare DDM and LBA fitted to behavioral data and further investigate possible benefits and drawbacks of each mode of analysis. To reduce the scope of this body of work, all EAM analysis will be conducted using the DDM.

The standard DDM for two-choice tasks assumes a noisy accumulation of pieces of evidence supporting one of two response alternatives. Once the accumulated amount of evidence pointing towards one of the response alternatives reaches a certain threshold, a response is given. Several different parameters guide this process. First, response time is separated into decision time, where the noisy evidence accumulation process takes place, and non-decision time _T~er~_. Non-decision time incorporates processes such as stimulus encoding and motor processes. Decision time is further controlled by three main parameters: (1) boundary separation _a_ describes the distance between decision thresholds and represents the amount of evidence required to reach a decision, (2) mean drift rate _v_ is the average rate at which evidence is accumulated and (3) mean starting point _z_ represents the average point at which, with some potential a-priori bias towards one of the two-choice alternatives, the evidence accumulation process begins. Further parameters of across-trial variability are added to reflect changes in diffusion model parameters over time. Variability of the starting point _s~z~_ accounts for differences in a-priori bias towards one response alternative across trials [@laming1968; @ratcliff1998]. Variability of drift rate $\eta$ reflects changes in drift rate across trials and allows the model to account for systematic differences between trials, such as error responses being systematically faster than correct responses [@ratcliff1978; @ratcliff1998]. Finally, variability of non-decision time _s~t~_ reflects fluctuations in the duration of encoding or motor-execution processes across trials. **I won't use full ddm, no need to explain it. But move that to discussion!** 

@dutilh2012testing outlined several explanations of PES and the respective parameters in the DDM that would be able to reflect these accounts. The aim of their study was to investigate which of the different accounts find greatest support in diffusion model analysis of their data. Dutilh et al. investigated support for five different accounts of PES, each mapping to a change in one parameter of the DDM. Since no studies to date have supported accounts corresponding to a shift in starting point _z_ or decreased variability _s~z~_ following an error, only three of the five mappings will be discussed further here.

(1) Delayed startup of evidence accumulation following an error response [@rabbitt1977] finds reflection in longer non-decision time _T~er~_ on trials following an error. Increases in _T~er~_ were able to account for PES in a random dot motion task [@dutilh2013]. While not directly affecting accuracy and thus not being strictly attributable to either adaptive or maladaptive accounts of PES, the only account predicting increases in _T~er~_ is the lag induced by longer _error monitoring processes_ [@dudschig2009; @jentzsch2009].
(2) Distraction of attention leading to impaired evidence accumulation, caused by an orienting response [@notebaert2009] or diminished cognitive resources due to error-monitoring processes [@dudschig2009; @jentzsch2009] leads to lower drift rates _v_ following an error. Lowered drift rates in post-error trials compared to pre-error trials were found in multiple tasks [@purcell2016; @dutilh2013; @schiffler2017].
(3) An increase in boundary separation _a_ corresponds to increased caution when responding after an error. Changes in _a_ are predicted by the cognitive control account of PES [@botvinick2001]. Following an error, cognitive control is exerted in order to prevent occurrence of future errors. Heightened caution is reflected in a larger amount of evidence needed to reach a decision. An increase in _a_ was able to predict PES in a range of studies [@purcell2016; @dutilh2012testing; @schiffler2017]. 

@dutilh2012testing found increases in boundary separation _a_ following error trials to be responsible for PES, increases in _T~er~_ or decreases in _v_ were not supported by evidence. The authors interpret their findings as support for adaptive accounts of PES. Critically, the RSI (500ms) was of medium length and not as short as RSI leading to increases in the influence of maladaptive processes found in previous studies [@dudschig2009; @jentzsch2009; @buzzel2017]. Realizing a shorter RSI trial-condition might generate results lending more support maladaptive accounts. No study to date has fitted a DDM to data with RSI\ $< 300ms$ or systematically manipulated the RSI within participants to evaluate parameter shifts responsible for PES. The present study will attempt to fill this gap in research. 

Our aim is to evaluate the effects of different RSI on the nature of cognitive processes causing PES. To achieve this goal, we will realize two RSI conditions with respective lengths commonly used for short and long intervals. A Drift Diffusion Model will be fit to data in both conditions, allowing further dissection of cognitive processes underlying subjects' responses. Changes in DDM parameters between pre-error and post-error trials will be analysed for each RSI condition. According to theory outlined above, differential influences of adaptive/maladaptive processes at different RSI should lead to respective differences in changes in DDM parameters following an error trial. When the RSI is long, changes in DDM parameters leading to slower post-error response times (PES) should be mostly attributable to parameters linked to increased accuracy, such as an increased _boundary separation_. Changes in parameters reflecting attentional deficits, such as a decreased _drift rate_ should account for PES at shorter RSI. 
<!-- While changes in _T~er~_ are not strictly adaptive or maladaptive in the sense that they influence post-error accuracy, increased non-decision time following error trials should primarily be found at short RSI. **maybe just discuss this later** -->
