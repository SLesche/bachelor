## Introduction
"What does a person do after an error?" this title of the seminal article by @rabbitt1977 holds a question relevant for everyday life, and most certainly a question to be answered by research. When investigating response-time tasks in research settings, the prevailing answer seems to be "they slow down" [e.g. @laming1968; @rabbitt1966a]. This phenomenon, entering psychological literature under the name _post-error slowing_ (PES), describes the change in response times after subjects commit an error in a response-time task [@laming1968; @laming1979; @rabbitt1966a; @rabbitt1966b; @rabbitt1977; @rabbitt1979]. Average response times in trials immediately following an error are often slower than average response times in trials following a correct response. The cause of PES is still widely discussed [see @danielmeier2011 for a brief overview] and often attributed to one of two general lines of thought.

The first line of thought attributes PES to changes in information processing which aim to prevent further errors. These accounts of PES predict that errors lead to slower response times but improved accuracy in trials following an error. Subjects that commit an error may try to prevent further occurrences of errors by slowing down their response, leading to a less error-prone _speed-accuracy tradeoff_ [@rabbitt1979]. Another theory attributes PES to the exertion of cognitive control over the decision process [@botvinick2001]. The amount of cognitive control required is determined by a _conflict monitoring_ function. Error trials lead to increased conflict, triggering stronger exertion of cognitive control to decrease further conflict on the following trial. In turn, increased cognitive control caused by an error in the previous trial elicits slower, but more accurate responses [@botvinick2001]. Accounts attributing PES to cognitive processes that lead to _improved_ accuracy in post-error trials will henceforth be referred to as _adaptive accounts_ of PES.

The other line of thought considers PES as a result of processes leading to reduced accuracy following an error. @notebaert2009 posit that error responses in research settings are often rarer than correct responses. The sheer infrequency of an error of commission then leads to an orienting response, diverting attention away from the current task and affecting performance on the trial following an infrequent error. @jentzsch2009 argue that given responses are always monitored for errors [see also @welford1959]. This _error-monitoring process_ requires cognitive resources which are therefore no longer available to central cognitive processes that are involved with generating a response to a new stimulus. Response times in the following trial will increase if the monitoring process lasts longer than the time between the potential error response and the onset of the following (post-error) trial. Following an incorrect response, both the executed incorrect and the appropriate correct response are likely represented. This in turn generates conflicting information that requires longer duration error-monitoring processes to be resolved [@laming1979; @rabbitt1977]. Monitoring processes following an error are therefore more likely to impair cognitive resources otherwise directed towards the task at hand than monitoring processes following a correct response. Responses following an error are predicted to be slower and less accurate. Accounts attributing PES to cognitive processes which lead to _reduced_ accuracy in post-error trials will be referred to as _maladaptive accounts_ of PES.

Adaptive and maladaptive accounts of PES both posit an increase in response time in post-error trials but seem to be at odds regarding the accuracy of post-error trials. Support for adaptive accounts of PES comes from behavioral data showing accuracy increases [@laming1979; @steinhauser2017; @mooji2021], mathematical models of cognitive processes suggesting increased caution [@dutilh2012testing; @schiffler2017] and neurophysiological research using electroencephalography (EEG) which showed decreases in alpha power following errors [@carp2009; @saunders2012]. Conversely, a variety of studies show behavioral decreases in accuracy following errors [@dali2022error; @vanderborght2016errors; @dudschig2009; @jentzsch2009; @houtman2013] or following infrequent events more generally [@castellar2010; @notebaert2009]. Additionally, some EEG studies show impaired cognitive processes measured via perception-related _event related potential_ (ERP) components [@buzzel2017; @vanderborght2016errors] and a number of studies using mathematical models of cognitive processes show decreases in attention [@purcell2016; @dutilh2013; @schiffler2017]. These findings lend support to maladaptive accounts of PES.

<!-- - reduced accuracy in post-error trials [@dali2022error; @vanderborght2016errors; @dudschig2009; @jentzsch2009; @houtman2013] -->

Intrigued by the diversity of these findings regarding the adaptive and maladaptive nature of PES, @jentzsch2009 identified the response-stimulus interval (RSI) as a key variable moderating the influence of processes deemed adaptive or maladaptive. Depending on the time between a subject's response to trial _n_ and the onset of trial _n+1_, @jentzsch2009 were able to observe different patterns of behavioral changes following an error. In conditions with a long RSI (1000ms), errors led to increased response times and a slight increase in accuracy, lending support to adaptive accounts of PES. However, in conditions with a short RSI (50ms), the same increase in response times was paired with a decrease in accuracy. This finding is supportive of maladaptive accounts. The time between the error response and onset of the following trial thus influences whether patterns supporting adaptive or maladaptive accounts are found [@dudschig2009].
<!-- The same pattern of shorter RSI leading to decreases in accuracy, while longer RSI led to increases or significantly smaller accuracy losses was replicated for four different levels of RSI [@dudschig2009]. -->

This pattern in the appearance of adaptive or maladaptive accounts may grant insight into the cognitive processes responsible for post-error slowing. Importantly, even though adaptive and maladaptive accounts postulate different cognitive processes underlying PES, these processes are not necessarily mutually exclusive [@danielmeier2011; @steinhauser2017; @schiffler2017]. Different cognitive processes may influence response times on trial _n+1_ depending on the time passed since the response to trial _n_ (RSI). Error-monitoring processes should only impair response time and accuracy if they last longer than the RSI. Should the error-monitoring process of trial _n_ come to a conclusion prior to the start of trial _n+1_, central cognitive resources are fully available to be dedicated to responding to trial _n+1_ [@jentzsch2009; @dudschig2009]. Similarly, orienting responses following the infrequent appearance of an error divert attention away from the task for a short period of time, after which the subject refocuses on the task at hand [@notebaert2009]. Cognitive processes underlying maladaptive accounts of PES only influence response behaviour if trial _n+1_ begins shortly after trial _n_ concludes. Cognitive processes hypothesized to be responsible for PES by adaptive accounts are assumed to take some amount of time before they can influence information processing. For example, increased cognitive control is only recruited after _conflict monitoring_ systems detect increased conflict and relay the need for increased cognitive control [@botvinick2001].  Depending on the time between the response to trial _n_ in which an error is committed and the onset trial _n+1_ (RSI), different cognitive processes following an error may be active and responsible for PES [@ullsperger2016]. 

In their study, @buzzel2017 utilized EEG recordings to investigate the cognitive processes underlying PES at various length of the RSI. They focused on examining alterations in specific ERP-components as potential indicators of compromised sensory processing, potentially resulting from attentional deficits. Their findings revealed a noteworthy decrease in P1 amplitude, reflecting impaired sensory processing, subsequent to an error. However, this reduction in P1 amplitude was solely observed when the RSI was short (>533ms). Conversely, at longer RSI, these deficits were not observed. These results provide evidence in support of the time-specific nature of attentional deficits triggered by errors.

### Evidence Accumulation Models
<!-- Because my supervisor won't let me use EEG to investigate my hypothesis... -->
The present study will make use of _evidence accumulation models_ (EAM), more specifically the _drift diffusion model_ (DDM) [@ratcliff1978], to investigate cognitive processes underlying behavior in response-time tasks. EAM enable mapping model parameters to specific cognitive processes responsible for the response-behavior of each subject [@voss2004; @dutilh2012testing]. 
<!-- Response times and accuracy can be entered into the model jointly, avoiding speed-accuracy tradeoff issues regarding the separate interpretation of response time and accuracy [@wagenmakers2007; @wickelgren1977]. --> 

<!-- **move this following section to discussion?** -->
<!-- In order to be comparable to previous research on PES using EAM [@purcell2016; @dutilh2012testing; @dutilh2013; @schiffler2017], this study will focus on modeling response data using the DDM. Recent publications have however pointed to potential issues arising with fitting DDM to PES data and have suggested using _linear ballistic accumulator_ (LBA) modeling [@brown2008] to avoid misfits [@damaso2022]. Future research will aim to compare DDM and LBA fitted to behavioral data and further investigate possible benefits and drawbacks of each mode of analysis. To reduce the scope of this body of work, all EAM analysis will be conducted using the DDM. -->

<!-- old/basic way of including images -->

The basic DDM for two-choice tasks assumes a noisy accumulation of pieces of evidence supporting one of two response alternatives (see Figure \@ref(fig:introduction-ddm-slide)). Once the accumulated amount of evidence is sufficient to reach a certain threshold representing one of the response alternatives, a response is given. Several different parameters guide this process. First, response time is separated into decision time, where the noisy evidence accumulation process takes place, and non-decision time $T_{er}$. Non-decision time incorporates processes such as stimulus encoding and motor processes. Decision time is further controlled by three main parameters: (1) the boundary separation $a$ describes the distance between decision boundaries and represents the amount of evidence required to reach a decision, (2) the mean drift rate $v$ is the average rate at which evidence is accumulated and (3) the mean starting point _z_ represents the average point at which the evidence accumulation process begins and can account for an a-priori bias towards one of the two-choice alternatives.
<!-- Further parameters of across-trial variability are added to reflect changes in diffusion model parameters over time. Variability of the starting point _s~z~_ accounts for differences in a-priori bias towards one response alternative across trials [@laming1968; @ratcliff1998]. Variability of drift rate $\eta$ reflects changes in drift rate across trials and allows the model to account for systematic differences between trials, such as error responses being systematically faster than correct responses [@ratcliff1978; @ratcliff1998]. Finally, variability of non-decision time _s~t~_ reflects fluctuations in the duration of encoding or motor-execution processes across trials. **I won't use full ddm, no need to explain it. But move that to discussion!**  -->

@dutilh2012testing outlined several explanations of PES and the respective parameters of the DDM that would be able to reflect these accounts. The aim of their study was to investigate which of the different accounts find greatest support in diffusion model analyses of their data. Since no studies to date have supported accounts corresponding to changes in starting point _z_ following an error, only three out of the five mappings outlined will be discussed in the following.

(1) An increase in boundary separation $a$ corresponds to increased caution when responding after an error. Changes in $a$ are predicted by the cognitive control account of PES [@botvinick2001]. Following an error, cognitive control is exerted in order to prevent the occurrence of future errors. Heightened caution is reflected in a larger amount of evidence needed to reach a decision. An increase in $a$ was able to predict PES in a range of studies [@purcell2016; @dutilh2012testing; @schiffler2017].

(2) Delayed start-up of evidence accumulation following an error response [@rabbitt1977] is reflected in longer non-decision time $T_{er}$ on trials following an error. Increases in $T_{er}$ were able to account for PES in a random dot motion task [@dutilh2013].

(3) Distraction of attention leading to impaired evidence accumulation, caused by an orienting response [@notebaert2009] or diminished cognitive resources due to error-monitoring processes [@dudschig2009; @jentzsch2009] is reflected by lower drift rates $v$ following an error. Lowered drift rates in post-error trials compared to pre-error trials were found in multiple tasks [@purcell2016; @dutilh2013; @schiffler2017].


@dutilh2012testing found increases in boundary separation $a$ following error trials to be responsible for PES, increases in $T_{er}$ or decreases in $v$ were not supported by their data. The authors interpret these findings as support for adaptive accounts of PES. Notably, the response-stimulus interval (RSI) utilized in this study was set to 500ms. This can be considered a medium duration RSI and does not fall within the range of RSIs that have previously been associated with heightened maladaptive processes [@dudschig2009; @jentzsch2009; @buzzel2017]. Incorporating a shorter RSI condition may reveal results lending more support to maladaptive accounts. No study to date has fitted a DDM to data with RSI\ $< 300$ ms or systematically manipulated the RSI to evaluate parameter shifts responsible for PES. The present study will attempt to fill this gap in research.

Our aim is to evaluate the nature of cognitive processes causing PES depending on the time of the onset of trial _n+1_ following an error (RSI). It is plausible that error responses lead to not just a singular adaptive or maladaptive process but a multitude of processes [@ullsperger2016], some affecting response behavior for a short time immediately after the error [@jentzsch2009; @dudschig2009; @notebaert2009] and others affecting response behavior only after prior processes have deemed their involvement necessary [@botvinick2001]. We want to investigate whether processes put forth by maladaptive accounts lead to attentional deficits, reflected in lower drift rates $v$ especially immediately following the error. The influence of these maladaptive processes should diminish as more time passes. After some time, processes deemed adaptive begin to influence response behavior, causing increases in boundary separation $a$. We hypothesize that parameters responsible for increases in response times in post-error trials are dependent on the RSI. At short RSI, decreases in drift rate should be the main contributor to increases in response time. At long RSI, increases in boundary separation should lead to increases in response time.

To test our hypotheses, we systematically varied the RSI to be either short (200ms) or long (1000ms). This allows us to sample a point where short-term maladaptive processes should have more influence on response behavior and a point later on where maladaptive effects should diminish and adaptive processes exert more influence on response behavior. A Drift Diffusion Model will be fitted to data in both conditions, allowing further inspection of cognitive processes underlying subjects' responses. Changes in DDM parameters depending on the accuracy of the previous trial will be analysed for each RSI condition. When the RSI is long, PES should be mostly attributable to parameters linked to increased accuracy, such as an increased _boundary separation_. At shorter RSI, changes in parameters reflecting attentional deficits, such as a decreased _drift rate_, should account for PES.
<!-- **say something about ndt here? keep model problems with this in mind!** -->

<!-- While changes in _T~er~_ are not strictly adaptive or maladaptive in the sense that they influence post-error accuracy, increased non-decision time following error trials should primarily be found at short RSI. **maybe just discuss this later** -->
