   pages = {64-76},
   abstract = {People generally slow down after they make an error, a phenomenon that is more pronounced for older individuals than it is for young individuals. Here, we examine the origin of this age-related difference in posterror slowing (PES) by applying the diffusion model to data from young and older participants performing a random dot motion task and a lexical decision task. Results show that the PES effects on response time and accuracy were qualitatively different for young and older participants. A diffusion model analysis revealed that following an error, older participants became more cautious, processed information less effectively, and spent more time on irrelevant processes. This pattern was evident in both the random dot motion task and the lexical decision task. For young participants, in contrast, the origin of the PES effect depended on the task that was performed: In the random dot motion task, the PES effect was due to time spent on irrelevant processes; in the lexical decision task, the PES effect was due to increased caution and decreased effectiveness in information processing. Overall, PES effects were much larger in the lexical decision task than in the random dot motion task. These findings indicate that PES originates from the interplay of different psychological processes whose contribution depends on both task settings and individual differences.

   abstract = {Some data are presented showing the changes in choice-reaction time (CRT) and the probability of error (PE) on the five trials following an error in a two-choice experiment. The magnitudes of the increase in RT and the decrease in PE are different according as the error-trial stimulus is re-presented or the alternative stimulus is preservec. In addition, RT is quicker to recover its equilibrium value than is PE. This pattern of changes implicates two distinct adjustments to the underlying decision process following an error: (i) a selective outward adjustment of the boundary at which the error was uttered, and (ii) a delay, with respect to presentation of the reaction stimulus, of the epoch at which the subject begins sampling information from the stimulus display. When these ideas are concatenated with the sequential probability-ratio-test model for CRT, a theoretical relation can be derived between the difference in mean RT for an error and for the same response given correctly, on the one hand, and the decrease in PE on the trial following an error, given that the alternate stimulus is presented, on the other. This relation is satisfied by the data.},

   abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian modeling provides a flexible and interpretable way of extending simple models of cognitive processes. To introduce this special issue, we discuss four of the most important potential hierarchical Bayesian contributions. The first involves the development of more complete theories, including accounting for variation coming from sources like individual differences in cognition. The second involves the capability to account for observed behavior in terms of the combination of multiple different cognitive processes. The third involves using a few key psychological variables to explain behavior on a wide range of cognitive tasks. The fourth involves the conceptual unification and integration of disparate cognitive models. For all of these potential contributions, we outline an appropriate general hierarchical Bayesian modeling structure. We also highlight current models that already use the hierarchical Bayesian approach, as well as identifying research areas that could benefit from its adoption.},

   abstract = {Post-error slowing is one of the most widely employed measures to study cognitive and behavioral consequences of error commission. Several methods have been proposed to quantify the post-error slowing effect, and we discuss two main methods: The traditional method of comparing response times in correct post-error trials to response times of correct trials that follow another correct trial, and a more recent proposal of comparing response times in correct post-error trials to the corresponding correct pre-error trials. Based on thorough re-analyses of two datasets, we argue that the latter method provides an inflated estimate by also capturing the (partially) independent effect of pre-error speeding. We propose two solutions for improving the assessment of human error processing, both of which highlight the importance of distinguishing between initial pre-error speeding and later post-error slowing.},

The model gave a good account of all of the dependent variables--accuracy, correct and error response times, and their distributions--and provided a description of how the component processes involved in the lexical decision task were affected by experimental variables. All of the variables investigated affected the rate at which information was accumulated from the stimuli--called drift rate in the model. The different drift rates observed for the various classes of stimuli can all be explained by a 2-dimens;ional signal-detection representation of stimulus information. The authors discuss how this representation and the diffusion model's decision process might be integrated with current models of lexical access.

   journal = {Acta Psychologica},
   volume = {74},
   number = {2},
   pages = {123-167},
   abstract = {The paper discusses various arguments and lines of evidence with respect to discrete stage and continuous flow models of choice reaction processes and in particular to the applicability of the Additive Factor Method (AFM) which has always been strongly tied to discrete processing. The paper starts with a brief outline of Miller's three different aspects of ‘discrete’ and ‘continuous’ (internal code, transmission, transformation). It is argued that application of the AFM does not require discrete processing in all respects. Discrete internal codes are essential, discrete transmission is preferable but not absolutely necessary, while continuous transformation can be easily accommodated. Most research on the AFM shows consistent and robust evidence in favor of seven successive processing stages in traditional choice reactions. Some inconsistencies can be satisfactorily explained by effects of confounded variables; yet, there also remain some inconsistencies, in particular with respect to one-dimensional processing, which suggest limits of the AFM. A critical issue is speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT). Here, the decomposition technique proposed by Meyer et al. (1988a,b) offers a promising tool for studying discrete versus continuous processing. A second critical issue, basically at stake in selective attention paradigms, is what constitutes a signal. Finally, advocates of continuous flow often refer to psychophysiological research and in particular to evoked potentials (EP). It is argued that the relations between EP and behavioral research seem insufficiently clear-cut to allow conclusions on discrete stages versus continuous flow. In conclusion, discrete stage models should not be rejected too hastily. They tend to have stronger axioms and hence allow stronger predictions. Unless more explicit constraints are specified, continuous flow models have much less predictive power.},
